    - Apache
    - Nginx
    - Microsoft Internet Imformation Server(IIS)
- Web Server Stats :

## Apache Web Server
 - It is modular, and you decide which of its modules to install, e.g.
    - `mod_mime` to make sure the server includes the correct `Content - Type` header in its response
    - `mod_log_config` to configure logging of HTTP requests
    - `mod_sel` for encryption using the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security protocols
- You enable/disable and configure the modules that you have installed by placing **directives** into config files
- The main configuration file is called **httpd.conf**

- Server Name : name of webserver domain(www)
- Listen : port(80)
- DocumentRoot : Root directory of webserver(/www/webpage/). **The URL pathname is appended to the DocumentRoot pathname.**

Examples : 
- /var/www */html/cats/tonkinese.html*

## User Web Sites
`moduser_dir` allows a specific directory that is not the server's root to host a site
