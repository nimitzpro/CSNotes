# Character sets
- A **character set** is a collection of characters
    - E.g. the ASCII character set is 128 characters, mostly from the modern Latin alphabet
    - The Unicode character set is currently a little over 100,000 characters
- A **coded character** set assigns a unique number to each distinct character
    - E.g. in Unicode/ASCII, 'A' is 65 and 'a' is 97.
- A **character encoding** refers to the way the numbers are converted to bytes for storage and transmission
    - ASCII uses 7 bits for every character
    - UTF-32 uses 4 bytes for every character
    - UTF-8 uses 1 byte for ASCII characters and 2,3,4 for others
