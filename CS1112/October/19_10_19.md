>## Introduction to Logic
Logic is the study of rational argument
- Given a set of facts, and an argument claiming that a conclusion follows from those facts, how do we decide whether or not the argument is justified?
- In order to do this, we ned a precise language to state the facts, the conclusions and the steps of the argument

### Rational Arguments
- It is about cold, calm, rational argument
    - It may help you in normal arguments if you can spot logical flaws, or statements that don't make sense, or ambiguities or mistakes in what is being asked for, but it is not going to tell you when to raise your voice

#### The aim : 
- Strip away the emotions and only use the facts

#### A proposition is a statement that declares a fact and is either true or false
