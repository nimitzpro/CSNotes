## Compound Statements
### Disjunction(v)
- This is true is either proposition is true
- v = "||" = "OR" = "+"
- For n propositions there are 2^n combinations(c) and 2^c outputs

#### Standard OR is inclusive whereas exclusive XOR is more similar to the English definition.

### Conditional(->)
- This connects 2 propositions. The resulting statement is true whenever the second propositions is true, or when the first proposition is false; otherwise the conditional statement is false
    - "If p, then q"
    - "Since p is true, q must be true"
    - Inversely if p is false, q must be false
    - If p is true and q is false it returns false
    - If p is false and q is true it returns true
- Conditional = NOT(p) OR q
#### p does not cause q

### Biconditional(<->)
- The resulting statement is true whenever both propositions have the same truth value; otherwise the biconditional statement is false.
    - p iff q 
#### p <-> q = (p->q) AND (q->p)
