## Order Relations
#### A homogeneous relation R *subset of* AxA is an order relation iff:
- R is anti-symmetric
    - Anti-symmetric for Relation '<': if x < y and x != y, then y !< x
- R is transitive
    - Transitive for Relation '<': if x < y and y < z, then x < z

### Strict Order
An order is a *strict order* iff :
>- R is anti-symmetric
>- R is transitive
>- **R is also anti-reflexive**

### Total Order
An order R *subset of* AxA is a total order iff:
- for any a and b in A, either aRb or bRa or a=b
- E.g. '<=' relation

### Partial Order
An order is partial if it is not total

- E.g. U = {a,b,c,d}
    - S1 = {a,b,c} and S2 = {b,c,d}
    - S1 *!subset of* S2 and S2 *!subset of* S1
- So *subset of* is a partial order on sets

#### There are different definitions for partial, strict and total orders.

### The Hasse Diagram
We can use the concept of the transitive closure to simplify the representation of relations.
