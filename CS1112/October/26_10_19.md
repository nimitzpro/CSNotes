## The Structure of Logical Statements
- p : User is logged out
- q : Balance is hidden
- s : Transaction processing
1. p -> q
    - If the user is logged out then the balance is hidden
2. (¬(¬q AND s))
    - Inverse of (If the balance is not hidden and the transaction is processing)
- (p->q) AND (¬(¬q AND s))

#### Alternative
- (p OR s) -> q

### A way to determine the structure of a wff is to use a tree
- ((p->q) OR (¬(r AND s)))
- (A OR B)
    - A = (C -> D)
    - B = ¬E
        - E = (F AND G)

### Order of Operation
"You are allowed in this bar if you are at least 18 or it is before 9pm and you are accompanied by a parent."
- q OR (r AND w)
#### When there are no brackets, order by :
1. ¬ (NOT)
3. AND (^)
3. OR (V)
4. Conditional (->)
5. Biconditional (<->)
- When there are equals, bracket from left to right.

#### Problems
- p V q ^ r -> ¬q
    - This changes to (p V (q ^ r)) -> (¬q)

- p V q V r V s ^ t ^ w
    - ((p V q) V r) V ((s ^ t) ^ w)

- (q->r) V p ^ ¬r
    - (q->r) V (p ^ (¬r))
        - Columns :
        - ¬r
        - (p ^ (¬r))
        - (q->r)
        - (q->r) V (p ^ (¬r))
