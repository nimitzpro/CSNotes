#### Each input can only have at most one output.

### It is important to know if a function has an inverse.
#### If a function does not have an inverse, then the original data has been lost.

- If f(x) and g(x) are surjective, then gOf(x) is surjective
- If f(x) and g(x) are injective, then gOf(x) is injective
- If f(x) and g(x) are bijective, then gOf(x) is bijective. It also has an inverse.

#### Sets A and B have the same cardinality iff it is possible to create a bijection from A to B.
