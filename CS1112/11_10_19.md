## More relations

Let A and B be 2 sets, and let a *E* A and b *E* B

R is a binary relation between A and B iff R *subset of* A x B
#### This mean the relation R is a set of ordered pairs

### Operations on Relations

#### In relations, *u* = OR, and *n* = AND.

Let R *subset of* AxB and S *subset of* CxD<br>
Then R *u* S, R *n* S, R\S and R' are all relations

E.g. R *u* S *subset of*(A *u* C) x (B *u* D)<br>
(x,y) *E* R*u*S iff (x,y) *E* R or (x,y) *E* S

E.g. R' *subset of* A x B, where U = A x B<br>
(x,y) *E* R' iff (x,y) *!E* R
