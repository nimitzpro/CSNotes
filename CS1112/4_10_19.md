### The cartesian product of two sets A and B id the set of all poosible ordered pairs where the first element comes from A and the second from B. 

A x B 
A ={Apple, banana}

B ={0,1}

A x B ={(Apple, 0),(Apple,1),(banana,0),(banana,1)}

|(A x B)|=|A| x |B|

Let B âŠ† A1 x A2 x ... x An

### The projection of B onto A is the subset of elements of A1 that appear in the right position in one if the tuples in B.

## Functions

- A relationship between two sets
- Translates an input element to an output

If f(a)=b then b is the image of a under f

Surjective/Onto:All elements in the codomain have at least one input, and all are used 

Bijective : all elements in the codomain have exactly 1 input and all are used

Injective : All outputs have at most one input and the output is unique
