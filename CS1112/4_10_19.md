### The cartesian product of two sets A and B id the set of all poosible ordered pairs where the first element comes from A and the second from B. 

A x B 
A ={Apple, banana}

B ={0,1}

A x B ={(Apple, 0),(Apple,1),(banana,0),(banana,1)}

|(A x B)|=|A| x |B|

Let B ⊆ A1 x A2 x ... x An

### The projection of B onto A is the subset of elements of A1 that appear in the right position in one if the tuples in B.

## Functions

- A relationship between two sets
- Translates an input element to an output

If f(a)=b then b is the image of a under f

Surjective/Onto:All elements in the codomain have at least one input, and all are used 

Bijective : all elements in the codomain have exactly 1 input and all are used

Injective : All outputs have at most one input and the output is unique

## Relations represent connections between objects and connections between sets of objects
### To learn : 
- Ways of representing relations
- Properties of relations
- How to combine and manipulate relations/relational DBs
- Equivalence relations
- Order relations

### Representing relations
- Using a matrix
- Using a table
- Arrow diagram(similar graph to function mapping Input->Output)

#### R is a relation between two sets A and B iff R ⊆ A x B

A={1,2,3}
B={x,y}
Cartesian product = {(1,x)}

#### The set of all possible relations between A and B is the power set of A x B


To understand a binary relation we need three parts : 
- Source
- Target
- Extension

Prefix Notation : R(a,b)<br>
Element : a,b ∈ R

E.g. (2,1) ∉ < relation

#### The source and target can be the same set or different sets.

#### Every relation has an inverse.

≥ is the opposite of <

#### A relation isn't a function but a function is a special type of relation.

### A binary relation R ⊆ A x B is functional iff for each a ∈ A there is exactly one b ∈ B
