## Logical Equivalence and Satisfiability

### Tautologies, Contradictions and Satisfiability

#### Tautology : A function that is always true equivalent to true

#### Contradiction : A function that is always equivalent to false

#### Satisfiable functions lie in between tautologies and contradictions.(equivalence depends)

#### Two formals are equivalent iff they have the same truth functions

#### De Morgan's Laws
- ¬(p ^ q) = ¬p v ¬q
- ¬(p v q) = ¬p ^ ¬q
