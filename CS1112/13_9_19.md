Computer science is the study of :
- Computer systems
- Computer software
- Computation

A model is a representation of a world that can be used to explain ro predict or demonstrate features of the world that is being modelled.

Computer science is all about models - representing them, manipulating them, and understanding their limitations.

### To learn :
- How to describe collections of objects
- How to express yourself clearly and precisely
- How to understand requirements
- How to understand arguments
- How to analyse what you have done
- Many techniques used throughout computer science

## A High Level Introduction to Algorithms
#### A sequence of step to achieve a task is an algorithm.

#### An algorithm is an ordered, deterministic, executable, terminating set of instructions.
