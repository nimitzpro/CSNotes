## Reasoning with Graphs
### Oriented edges
- An orientation of an edge assigns a direction to that edge, selecting one of the edges as the startpoint

### Paths
- A path in a graph is a sequence of oriented edges, such that the endpoint of one oriented edge is the startpoint of the next oriented edge in the sequence

- For simple graphs, we can describe a path by listing the sequence of vertices it visits, since each pair of vertices is linked by at most one edge.
- A path <(a,b),(b,e),(e,f),(f,c)> can be represented by <a,b,e,f,c>
- For a paath <v1...vn>
	- v1 is the start of the path
	- vn is the end of the path

### Multiple paths in simple graphs
- For a given pair of vertices, there may be many different paths which connect them.
- <a,b,c,f>
- <a,b,e,f>
- <a,c,f>...

### Connected graphs
- A graph is connected if every pair of vertices v,w can be connected by a path which starts at v and ends at w

#### How do we find the shortest path?
- Breadth First Search Algorithm
