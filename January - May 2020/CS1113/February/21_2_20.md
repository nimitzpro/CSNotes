## Circuits
### Euler Circuits
- An Euler circuit is a circuit that contains every edge in the graph exactly once
- An Euler path is a path that contains every edge in the graph exactly once

### The Bridges of Konigsberg
- Is there an Euler circuit for the Bridges of Konigsberg
- **No**

#### A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex in the graph has an even degree.

### Hamiltonian Circuits
- A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that contains every vertex in the graph exactly once
- A Hamiltonian path is a path that contains every vertex in the graph exactly once

#### There are no known efficient algorithms(better than 2^n) for finding out whether a graph has a Hamiltonian circuit

#### Travelling Salesman Problem
- Find the cheapest circuit that visits every city, but doesn't visit any city twice

#### There are no known efficient algorithms for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem.

### Representing Graphs
Adjacency list representation
- Upsides
    - Easy to use for directed graphs
    - Easy to use for edge of vertex-weighed graphs
    - Can also be used for multigraphs
    - Only requires space for the edges that exist
- Downsides
    - Slow to process, since we have to search the adjacency list to find out whether two vertices are connected

Table representation / Matrix
- Upsides
    - Easy to use for asymmetrical edges
- Downsides
    - Takes more space (n*n space required for n vertices)
    - Can't be used for multigraphs

### The Graph is not the Sketch
- The way we draw the graph on the page does not change the actual graph

### Isomorphic Graphs
- Suppose we have 2 graphs G1 and G2
- If we can rename the vertices in G1 so that G1 and G2 become the same graph, then G1 and G2 are isomorphic
