## The Language of Predicate Logic (Version 1)
- U is the universal set (or domain of discourses) of constants
- V is a set of variables such that V *n* U = [phi]
- [pi] is a set of predicate symbols such that [pi] *n* V = [pi] *n* U = [phi]

1. If P is a predicate symbol *E* [pi] and t*1*, t*2* ... t*i* *E* V *u* U, then P(t*1*,t*2* ... t*i) is a well formed formula

2. If W is a wff and x is a variable, then ***A***x W and ***E*** x W are wffs

3. If W*1* and W*2* are wffs, then ¬W*1*, W*1* ^ W*2*.... are wffs

4. If W is a wff, then (W) is a wff

5. Nothing else is a wff

### Example
> Let the domain(U) be the set of students in the UCC database<br>
> Let president(x) be the predicate which is true when x is the President of Ireland<br>
> There is no student who is the President of Ireland
> Rewrite as there does not exist a student such that the student is the President of Ireland

#### Answer
- ¬***E***x president(x) ~ ***A*** ¬president(x) 
- This says for each student, the student is not the President of Ireland
