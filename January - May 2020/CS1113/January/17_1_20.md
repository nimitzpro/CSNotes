## Introduction to Predicate Logic

We need to expand our logical language to talk about sets of objects.

**Predicates** are relations acting on elements of sets. **Quantifiers** say how many elements must satisfy the relation.

Instead of using 4000 simpler statements, now we can say that :
- The network is secure if and only if all computers on the network have an active copy of *Fireguard*
    - Quantifier : All
    - Element in a set : computer on the network
    - Predicate : Active copy of *Fireguard*

### Notation for Predicates
- Each predicate will have a name. The name may be a word of a single capital letter
- Each predicate must be applied to a specified number of objects taken from specified sets (or to variable representing those objects)
- We write the objects and variable in the specifies order between round brackets after the predicate name : 
     - has_firewall(comp23)

PredicateName(element) -> true/false
