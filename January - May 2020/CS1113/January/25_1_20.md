## Restricting the domain
- Sometimes we will want to make statements about a subset of the universal set
- Suppose U is the set of integers Z. How do we say for all x bigger than 1, x^2 > x?

*For all integers x, if x is bigger than 1 then x^2 is bigger than x:*
- ***A*** ((x > 1) -> (x^2 > x))

Alternatively : 
- ***A***x > 1 x^2 > x

### Example 
"All students in UCC have a UCC ID card"
- Let the domain U be the set of all people

### Potential Answers :
- First attempt :
    - Let uccStudent(x) mean x is a UCC student
    - Let uccCard(x) mean x has a UCC ID card
    - ***A***x (uccStudent(x) -> uccCard(x))

- Alternatively if S is the set of all UCC students, we could say :
    - ***A*** x *E* S uccCard(x)
    
- And if U = S :
    - ***A***x uccCard(x)

## Multiple Quantifiers in Predicate Logic
So far all our example predicate logic statements have had a single quantified variable, but the language doesn't restrict multiple quantifiers.

In an expression in predicate logic, the scope of a quantifier is the sub-part of the expression to which it applies - either the predicate immediately following it, or a wff in brackets.
- E.g. ***A***x(P(x) -> ***E***yQ(y))

- The scope of ***A***x is (P(x) -> ***E***yQ(y))
- The scope of ***E***y is Q(y)

In quantified expressions, we can re-use the variable in the quantifiers if the scope of the quantifiers do not overlap
- E.g. ***A***P(x) ^ ***E***yQ(y) and
- ***A***xP(x) ^ ***E***xQ(y) are logically equivalent.

### Variable Bounding
- In a wff, a variable x is **bound** if it is inside the scope of either ***A***x or ***E***x (so it is quantified)
- In a wff, a variable x is **free** if it is not bound (if it is not quantified)

***A***x W is true iff for each constant a *E* U, when we replace all free occurrences of x in W by a, we get a true statement.

#### Two formulae are logically equivalent iff they both return the same truth values regardless of what interpretations of the predicates are used.
