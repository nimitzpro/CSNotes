## Quantifiers in Predicate Logic
- Upside down A (***A***) : the universal quantifier
- Backwards E : the existential quantifier

#### Conversion between Universal and Existential Quantifiers
- ¬***A*** ~ ***E***
- ¬***E*** ~ ***A***

### The aim
We now want to be able to talk about these statements with variables, and have a procedure to determine whether what we say is true or false
- Is there a value for the variable that makes the statement true?
- Which values make the statement true?
- How many values make the statement true?
- etc.

#### From now on, we will assume all predicates are defined over some universal set U (or over cross products)

### Universal Quantifier
- ***A***x firewall(x) : "For all computers, the computer has a firewall"
    - This is true if in all possible assignments of a value to x, firewall(x) is true
    - This is False if there is one or more possible assignments of a value to x that makes firewall(x) false

### Existential Quantifier
- ***E***x firewall(x) : "There exists a computer which has a firewall"
    - This is true if there is one or more possible assignments of a value to x that makes firewall(x) true
    - This is false if in all possible assignments of a value to x, firewall(x) is false

### Example
> Consider students currently registered on the UCC database.
> Represent the following using quantifiers and predicates
> 1. All students have a student ID number
> 2. Some students are American

- Let U be the set of UCC students
- Let hasID(x) state that x has a student ID number
- Let american(x) state that x is american

1. ***A***x hasID(x)
2. ***E***x american(x)

### Example 2 
> Consider students currently registered on the UCC database, and degree programmes in the UCC calendar
> Represent the following using quantifiers and predicates

- Let U be the set of UCC students and degree programmes
- Let student(x) state that x is a student
- Let studies(x,y) state that student x studies degree program y
- Let CS and CH be elements of U, representing Computer Science and Chinese

***E***x (student(x) ^ studies(x,CS) ^ studies(x,CH))

### Example 3
- Let P(x) be "x > 0" and Q(x) be "2x > 0", where U *E* Z
- Then the wff :
    -  ***A***x (P(x) -> Q(x))
- States that for all integers, P(x) implies Q(x)

### Example 4
> For all students in UCC, if the student is qualified to enter 2nd year, then the student must have earned 50 credits

- Let U be all students in UCC
- Let credits be that student x has achieved 50 or more credits
- Let qualified(x) mean that student x is qualified to enter 2nd year

***A***x (qualified(x) -> credits(x))

### Example 5
> For all students in UCC CS 1st year, either the student is registered for CS1105, or has a pass for CS1105, or has a pass for MA1015
