## Quantifers in Predicate Logic
- Upside down A (*A*) : the universal quantifier
- Backwards E : the existential quantifier

### The aim
We now want to be able to talk about these statements with variables, and have a procedure to detemine whether what we say is true or false
- Is there a value for the variable that makes the statement true?
- Which vvalues make the statement true?
- How many values make the statement true?
- etc.

#### From now on, we will assume all predicates are defined over some universal set U (or over cross products)

- *A*x firewall(x) : "For all computers, the computer has a firewall"
