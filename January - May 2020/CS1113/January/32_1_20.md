## Quantified Logic and Arguments
- Interpreting statements with multiple quantifiers
- The full predicate language

### Using functions in predicate logic
- Sometimes, we will want to make a statement about a function of an object rather than the object itself.
- Suppose in the UCC Database, we define a function *mentor*, which for each student designates a specific individual as a mentor
    - mentor  Students -> People
- Let *professor*(x) be the statement that x is a professor, where x is a person in the UCC database
- We can now make a claim about the database, there is at least one student who has a professor for a mentor :
    - ***E***x *professor*(*mentor*(x))

### Terms in Predicate Logic Sentences
- U is the universal set ( or domain of discourse) of constants
- V is a set of variables, such that V *n* U = [phi]
- [phi] is a set of function symbols, [phi] *n* V = [phi] *n* U = [phi]

1. Every symbol representing a specific element of U is a term
2. Every variable in V is a term
3. If *f* is a function symbol(*f* *E* [phi]), and t1, t2, ..., tn are terms, then *f*(t1, t2, ..., tn) is a term
4. Nothing else is a term
