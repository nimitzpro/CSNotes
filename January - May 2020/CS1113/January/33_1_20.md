## The Language of Predicate Logic (Version 2)
- [pi] is a set fo predicate symbols such that [pi] *n* V = [pi] *n* U = [pi] *n* [phi] = [phi]

1. If P is a predicate symbol *E* [pi] and t*1*, t*2* ... t*i* *E* V *u* U, then P(t*1*,t*2* ... t*i) is a well formed formula

2. If W is a wff and x is a variable, then ***A***x W and ***E*** x W are wffs

3. If W*1* and W*2* are wffs, then Â¬W*1*, W*1* ^ W*2*.... are wffs

4. If W is a wff, then (W) is a wff

5. Nothing else is a wff
