## Core Concept 
All information can be modelled using numbers and some appropriate conventions.

### Which number base?
#### Base-10
- Ten components: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- 'Natural' for people

#### Base-2
- Today machines use Base-2(Binary) : [0,1]
- Used to represent the voltage of transistors (on/off)

#### Base-16 
- Base-2 numbers are grouped into Base-16 to make them easier to read and understand

#### These are known as Positional Counting Systems.

### Transistors
- A transistor is a switch which can be in one of two states :
    - On (1)
    - Off (0)
- They can be turned on and off using voltages, thus they don't need to be changed by people
