## Implementing `AND`,`NOT` and `OR` using discreet transistors

....

#### In addition to the fundamental set of `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`, it is common to consider other gates(whose functionality is needed often and whose construction is a combination of `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`).

### `XOR` - Exclusive OR
| A | B |A `xor` B|
|-|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |


### `XNOR` - Exclusive NOR
| A | B |A `xnor` B|
|-|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
- `XNOR` is the inverse of `XOR`
- `XNOR` is also called **`COIN`, for coincidence**
- The output is 1 is the inputs are either both 1 or both 0

### `NAND` - NOT of AND
| A | B |A `nand` B|
|-|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
- `NAND` is the inverse of `AND`

### `NOR` - NOT of OR
| A | B |A `nor` B|
|-|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
- `NOR` is the inverse of `OR`
