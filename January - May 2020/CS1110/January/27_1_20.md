## Boolean Logic
- How can a 'chip' made of silicon and wires do something that seems like it requires human thought?
- To understand he answer, we need to understand **Boolean logic**.
- Boole's logic was used by Claude Shannon to develop **Switching Theory** in the 1930s
- Shannon showed how a "logic machine" could be built using switching circuits corresponding to Boolean Algebra

### Logic Gates
- A logic gate is an electronic circuit that "logically combines" inputs to produce outputs. By logically combining, we mean applying a **logic operator** to some operands to produce some output.
- A logic gate implements a **logic operator**

### `AND`,`OR`,`NOT`
- Boole considered 3 logic operators : `AND`,`OR`, and `NOT`
- Logic gates can be constructed for each of these, and for combinations of them
- With these logic gates, Boole's and Shannon's work showed that we can construct any electronic circuit whose outputs depend only on its inputs.

#### These are called combinatorial circuits.

### Modelling information using numbering is one thing, processing that information is another.
- By processing, we mean transforming/combining information to create new information
- Consider 2 + 3 = 5
    - This uses an operator +, to map two entities 2 and 3, into a new entity, 5. A **relationship** is created between the **operands** of + and its **result**.
- In a sense, we are creating/defining new information by doing this. The value/utility of this information depends on the meaning we attach to '+'.

- For the moment, we will only consider those functions whose output(O) depends only on its inputs (I)
    - O = f(I)
- The work of Boole and Shannon tells us that any function of this type can defined in terms of the three logic operators : `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.

### `AND` - Algebraically A * B
| A | B |A `and` B|
|-|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

### `OR` - Algebraically A + B
| A | B |A `or` B|
|-|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

### `NOT` - Algebraically A'
| A |`not` A|
|-|:-------:|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |
