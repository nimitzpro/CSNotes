## Bytes
- Bits are almost always bundled into 8-bit collections called bytes
- One byte can be represented by 2 hex digits
- A F -> 1010 1111
    - 1 byte (2 nibbles)
- A byte can represent 256 different 'things'
    - E.g. we can represent the numbers 0 to 255
- A single byte is also sufficient to represent all the characters in a Western Keyboard

### Character Encoding
- The American System for Coded Information Interchange(ASCII) character set is a standardised table in which each number from 0 to 255 is associated with either :
    - A **symbol**(that we call a **printable character**)
    - An **action**(that we call an **unprintable character**)

### Representing characters in a Program
The characters :
- '5'
- 53 (decimal)
- 35 (hex)
- 65 (octal)
#### These all point to the same sequence of bits in the C language, however this sequence of bits is interpreted differently depending on the data type.
