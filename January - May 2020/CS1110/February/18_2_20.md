### Full-Adder(3)
We have seen 2 implementations of the Full-Adder, each used to illustrate a specific idea. It should be clear therefore that there is not only one way of implementing the Full-Adder - or indeed any Combinatorial function.

### Another way to implement the Full-Adder
- Recall that the Half-Adder circuit adds two bits to give a half-sum and a carryout
- Also recall that the Full-Adder circuit adds three bits to give a sum and a carryout
