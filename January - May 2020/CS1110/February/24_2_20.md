## Subtraction
We will approach the operation of subtraction by converting the second operand into its negative equivalent and then adding : 
- E.g. 7 - 2 -> 7 + (-2)

a - b ~ a + (-b) ~ a + (`not`(b) + 1)

- In the circuit, the select line is used to choose between addition and subtraction, and acts as the carry-in.
- Thus, the select can be viewed as an instruction - choosing different pathways through the circuit
