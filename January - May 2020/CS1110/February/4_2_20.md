## Building a Logic Circuit to Implement a Full-Adder
- Construct a Truth table for a Full-adder by tabulating all possible combinations
- When the Carry-In is 0 : 
    - The sum is a `xor` b
    - The carry is a `and` b
- When the Carry-In is 1 :
    - The sum is a `coin` b
    - The carry is a `or` b
