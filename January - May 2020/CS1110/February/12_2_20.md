## Demultiplexing
- Demultiplexing is the inverse process of multiplexing
- A **1-2^n line demultiplexer** has 1 input, n select lines and 2^n outputs

#### Multiplexing and demultiplexing can be combined to reduce the amount of wires needed to transfer information from one location to another.

 ### Along with dynamically routing information, multiplexing can be used to implement the function described by any truth table.
 - This can be done by mapping the combinations to the inputs of the multiplexer and the inputs to the selectors of the multiplexer.
    - E.g. NOR : a and b are mapped to the selectors, while the combinations of these (0,1,1,0) are mapped to the inputs of the mux

#### What if there are multiple outputs?
- Use multiple multiplexers
- For a full adder implementation, we use 3 selectors copied to 2 multiplexers, and 8 inputs

**Note :** While implementing Boolean functions using multiplexers in this manner is 100% functionally correct, and simple, it is most likely **not** the "most efficient" way of doing so.

#### In light of the implementations described above, can we say anything profound about the implementation of combinatorial functions and the use of `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` ?
