## Fractional Numbers
There are two kinds :
- Fixed point numbers
- Floating point numbers

### Fixed Point Numbers
- Fixed point number representation attempts to represent numbers with a fixed number of bits to represent the whole part of the number and a fixed number to represent the fractional part of the number.
- These numbers can, of course, be signed or unsigned

#### Example
- We know that, with 8 bits we can represent whole numbers in the range 0 -> 2^8 - 1 unsigned, or -2^7 -> 2^7 -1 signed
- For fractional numbers, lets examine the case where we have 4 digits before and 4 digits after the decimal point.
#### We do not physically represent the decimal point in the bit sequence - we simply agree where it is. Once agreed, in a fixed point representation, it cannot be moved
- Whole Part :
    - -2^3 -> 2^3 -1
- Fractional Part : 
    - 2^-1 + 2^-2 + 2^-3 + 2^-4
    - 0 -> 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16
    - ~ 0 -> 15/16 ~ 0 -> 0.9375
#### There is a loss of accuracy inherent in representing fractions in computer systems. The more bits there are assigned to the fractional part, the more accurate it is.
- The resolution of fractional numbers in a bit sequence using 4 bits to represent fractions is 1/16, or 0.0625
