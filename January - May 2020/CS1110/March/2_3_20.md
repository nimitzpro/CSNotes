### Perfect Induction
- Basically write out the whole truth table to prove something

### Using De Morgan

1. Change all the operators
2. Complement each input variable
3. Complement the entire expression

E.g. change (A.B.C)' into `OR` form :
- (A + B + C)'
- (A' + B' + C')'
- (A' + B' + C')''
- (A.B.C)' ~ A' + B' + C'

We can apply De Morgan to part of an expression if we wih, this can be useful if part of the expression is already in the desired form : 
- Convert A + (B.C) to `AND` form

Treat the sub expression as a single variable : 
- X = (B.C)
- A + X -> A . X -> A' . X' -> (A' . X')'
- A + (B.C) ~ (A' . (B.C)' )'

### Building Circuits using `NAND` or `NOR` Gates Only
- We see tht De Morgan's Theorems allow us to eliminate either `OR` or `AND` operators from our operations, making it simpler.

#### The following questions arise : Since every equation can be expressed using only `AND` and `NOT` only, can they be expressed using `NAND` only?
#### Similarly, can they be constructed using `NOR` only?

Express `OR` using `NAND` : 
- A + B ~ (A' . B')'
- However this is incomplete 

#### So can we express A' or B' using `NAND` only?
- `NAND` can be used as an inverter

Thus :
- A + B ~ ((A.A)' . (B.B)')'

#### Expressing using `NOR` is done similarly.
