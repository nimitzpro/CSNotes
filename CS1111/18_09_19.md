### The CPU is composed of several parts
#### The control unit :
- fetches instructions from main memory and determines their type and what to do with them
#### The Arithmetic Logic Unit
- performs operations such as 
- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and 
- other operations such as AND, OR, NOT, Shift, Rotate

#### Registers :
- High speed memory locations used to store temporary results and certain control information
- Fast access because they are internal to the CPU
- Data registers for operand and result data

##### They are limited in size and number
- Number and size of each depends on wider architectural decisions
- These decisions influence program size, execution time, compiler complexity, etc.

##### Control registers to hold control information used for supporting the operation of the machine.
- The Program Counter(PC) also called the Instruction Counter or the Instruction Pointer holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched for execution
- The Instruction Register(IR) holds the instruction currently being executed
- The Status Register reflects the outcome of the execution of the previous instruction 
- The Stack Pointer is used to implement subroutine calls and returns

### Fetch-Decode-Execute
- The sequencing of the steps described below is done by the control unit issuing control signals to the relevant pieces of hardware at the relevant times
- Before the CPU can execute an instruction, the instruction must be first brought to the CPU from the computer's memory
- Our description of the way in which
