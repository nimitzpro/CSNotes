## `jmp` opcode

mov al, 00

loop: 
<br>*;label is called loop*<br> 

inc al 
<br>*;increment al by 1 (add al, 1)*<br>

jmp loop 
<br>*;'jumps' back to loop*<br>

end

- The jmp label instruction is translated by the assembler into C0 *number*
- Where *number* is the number of bytes between the jmp label instruction and the instruction identified by the label
- If it is backwards then *number* is negative
    - FF = -1, FE = -2, FD = -3 etc.
- If the label is ahead of the jmp, *number* is positive
    - 01 = 1, 02 = 2, 03 = 3, etc.

#### In the above example *number* is FC

### Other jump instructions include :
- jz label : jump to the label if the 0 flag is set
    - jnz label : jump to the label if the 0 flag is not set
- js/jns label : jump to the label if the sign flag is set/not set
- jo/jno label : jump to the label if the overflow flag is set/not set

### Memory Mapped I/O
- Certain portions of RAM are associated with different I/O devices(monitors, mouse/keyboard etc.)
