#### These are connected by buses which transfer information.

### The Assembly Language Level
- Assembly language abstracts away from the machine language by using symbolic names for instructions instead of binary or hex value
    - ADD, SUM, MUL, DIV
- Memory addresses can also be given symbolic names

The assembly programmer has access to all the features and instructions available on the target machine. The high level programmer cannot
- An assembly language program can execute every instruction in the instruction set of the target machine, but the high level language cannot
- Everything that can be done in machine language can be done in assembly language, but many instructions, registers and similar features are not directly available to the high level programmer

### Why Program in Assembly?
- Performance
- Access to the machine
- Understanding assembly language is essential to understanding how compilers work
- Writing some assembly code is the only way to get a fell for what a machine is really like at the architectural level
