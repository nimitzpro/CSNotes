## The OSM
- The operating system's tasks fall into 6 categories
### Processor Management
- Ensuring that each process has enough of the CPU's time to function
- Not using too much time switching contexts
#### Process Control Block
- An ID number that identifies the process
- Pointers to the locations in the program and to its data
- Register content
- States of various flags and switches
- Pointers to the upper and lower bounds of the memory required for the process
#### Process Switching
- Process switching happens without direct user interference and each process gets enough CPU cycles to accomplish its task in a reasonable amount of time
- The OS requires some CPU cycles to perform the context switching
- If too many processes are started, most of the CPu cycles will be used to perform the switching and little real work will be done. This is call **thrashing** and it usually requires some sort of direct user intervention to stop processes and bring order back to the system
#### Reducing Thrashing
- One way that OS designers reduce the chance of thrashing is by using threads. A thread performs all the CPU-intensive work of a normal process but does not require the extensive process control block of a regular process
- A process may start many threads or other processes, but a thread cannot start a process
- In a system with two or more cores, the OS must divide the workload among the cores, trying to balance the demands of the running processes with the available cycles on the different cores
    - **Asymmetric OSes** use one core for itself and divides application processes among the remaining CPU cores 
    - **Symmetric OSes** divide itself among the various cores, balancing demand vs core availability even when the operating system itself is all that's running
### Memory and Storage Management
When an operating system manages the computer's memory, it attempts to accomplish two general goals :
#### Each process must have enough memory in which to execute and processes must not interfere with each others memory
- This requires the OS to setup memory boundaries for individual applications
    - Applications are loaded into memory in block sizes determined by the OS
        - If the block size is 2kB, then every process that is loaded will be given a chunk of memory that is a multiple of 2kB in size
#### The different types of memory in the system must be used properly so that each process can run most effectively
- When RAM is scarce, moving information between RAM and hard disk can greatly expand the space available to applications.
    - This technique is called **virtual memory management**
    - Ranked in order of speed, the types of memory in a computer system are :
        - **High speed cache** : Fast, small amounts of memory accessible to the CPU through fast connections
        - **Main memory** : RAM
        - **Secondary Memory** : Disk, serves as *virtual RAM* under the control of the operating system

### Device Management
The path between the OS and practically all hardware not on the computer's motherboard goes through a special program called a **driver**
- A driver is a translator between the electrical signals of the hardware and the high-level programming language instructions of the OS and applications
- Diverse take data files and translate them into streams of bits for storage devices, or a series of laser pulses in a printer, for example

Because there are such wide differences in the hardware controlled through drivers, there are difference in the way that driver programs function
- Most are run when the device is required and function the same as most other processes

Drivers are separate from the OS so that the hardware can be changed without changing the OS.

Input and output between different devices and the processor is typically performed using **queues** and **buffers**

### Application Interface
Just as drivers provide a way for applications to make use of hardware subsystems, application program interfaces(APIs) allow programmers to make use of functions of the computer and OS
- APIs are very important in the computer industry. Companies often give free access to their software via APIs to encourage programmers to develop applications based on their code - thus giving the company added market share

### User Interface
Just as the API provide a structured and consistent way for applications to use the resources of the computer system, a user interface(UI) brings structure and a consistent "look and feel" to the interactions between a user and the computer
- In the last few decades, almost all development in user interfaces has been in the area of the **graphical user interfaces** (GUIs).
- Multi-modal interfaces are becoming increasingly common in recent years.

Traditionally, Unix used a text-based **shell interface**
- This is still the preferred mode of interaction among professionals
- There are also GUIs, such as X-Windows and Gnome

#### The ties between the OS kernel and the UI, device drivers, utilities and other software define many of the differences in operating systems today, and will further define them in the future.
