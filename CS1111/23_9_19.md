# Memory Architecture
### Goal : Fast, reliable, durable, inexpensive storage and retrieval of electronic information

### DRAM - Dynamic Random Access Memory
- Stored value represented by a capacitor's charge state
    - 1 capacitor
    - 1 access transistor
- A capacitor is like a small bucket that can store a charge
    - This charge can leak away quickly (ms) unless the capacitor's charge is refreshed
    - This refreshing is performed either by the CPU or y a dedicated memory controller
    - Every bit must be read and written-back 1000s of times a second

### SRAM - Static Random Access Memory
- Two cross-coupled inverters store a single bit
- Bit maintained by a feedback path
- 4 transistors for storage
- 2 transistors for access

#### SRAM is fast and expensive and used for cache.
#### DRAM is cheaper and slower and used for main memory.

## Memory Requirements
### An ideal computer memory would have :
- Zero access time
- Infinite capacity
- Zero cost
- Infinite bandwidth for multiple parallel access
### However 
- Bigger -> Slower
    - It takes longer to determine locations
- Faster -> Cost
    - SRAM vs DRAM
- Greater bandwidth -> Cost
    - More banks, ports, higher frequency, faster technology

## Why have a Memory Hierarchy?
- We want to have both speed and size
- Both cannot be achieved with a single level
- Therefore, use multiple levels of storage
- Bigger and slower with distance from the processor
- Ensure the most relevant data moves to the faster levels **before** it is needed
### Hierarchy
- Register File, 32 words, sub-nsec
- L1 Cache, ~32KB, nsecs
- L2 Cache, 512KB, many nsecs
- L3 Cache, 16MB...
- Main Memory, 16GB... >100nsecs
- Swap Disk, GBs... 10msecs

## Random Access Memory
- Computers express memory addresses as binary numbers
- If an address has m bits, the maximum number of addressable locations is 2^m
- The number of bits in the address is independent of the number of bits per location. A memory with 2^12 location of 8bits each and a memory with 2^12 locations of 64 bits each need 12-bit addresses
- Nearly all computer manufacturers have standardised on an 8-bit location, called a byte
- Bytes are grouped into words. A computer with a 32-bit words has 4 bytes per wor, whereas a computer with a 64-bit word has 8-bytes per word
- The significance of a word is that most instructions operate on entire words, for example, adding 2 words together
- Thus a 32-bit machine will have 32-bit registers and instructions for manipulating 32-bit words, whereas a 64-bit machine will have 64 bit registers and instructions for moving, adding, subtracting and otherwise manipulating 64-bit words

## Error Checking
- Modern Memory is reliable
- Memory controllers check for errors only on system start up
- However, some memory chips, requiring even greater reliability, have built-in error-checking and use parity checks to discover errors.
