## Binary and Hex Numbers
### Control Signals
- The lowest level of our computer hardware works by turning billions of tiny switches called transistors on and off
- These switches are either on or off
- We represent the off state with 0 and on state with 1 and we can construct sequences of 1s and 0s to represent multiple control signals
    - We use sequences of 1s and 0s to control our machine
    - These control signals act like instructions

<h3 style ="color:red;">
 A sequence of 1s and 0s can be interpreted as a number in Base 2.

### From Hex to Assembly Signals
- By design the sequence of hex digits representing instructions of a program will consist of groups of hex numbers - each group representing a distinct instruction
    - The design of these groups is done at the ISA Level
- The first hex number represents the operation to be performed(the OpCode) and subsequent hex number(if any) will represent operand data or the location of operand data
- In the Assembly Language the hex Opcode is given a name to describe the operation, the data may appear as a literal hex number and the location of the operand data may be a hex number referring to a register containing the data or the address of the data

### Different Move Instructions
- mov al, 15 : Moves 15 into al
- mov al, bl : Moves the value in bl into al
- mov al [80] : Moves the value in memory 80 into al
