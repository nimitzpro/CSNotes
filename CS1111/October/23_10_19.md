### Creating a Translation Table
- The ASCII table allows us to translate between symbols and number. We can view the ASCII table as the translation table

`org` 50<br>
`DB` FA
- This will place the byte FA into memory at address 50
- Each subsequent DB will place bytes into memory address increasing from 50
- There is no need to duplicate it for the RHS, just add 1 to the required image(number)
