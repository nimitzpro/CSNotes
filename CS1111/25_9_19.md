### Parity Checking RAM
- These chips have an extra bit for every bit for every 8 bits of data
- When data is being written to the memory, the chip adds up the total number of 1s in each byte in the memory
     - If the total is odd, the parity bit is set to 1
     - If the total is even, the parity bit is set to 0
- Because this process always results in an even number of 1s(incl. parity bit) it is known as an even parity scheme
- When data is being read from the memory, the chip will determine that the number of 1s in each byte conforms to the parity scheme. If so, no errors are reported,if not, something has gone wrong and the chip reports an error.

### Limitations of Parity Schemes
- It is possible to detect an error using parity checks, but it is not possible to identify the error, nor to correct it
- For example, if in an even parity scheme, a 9-bit data byte has an odd number of 1s - and error has occurred - but which bit(s) is/are wrong?
- Multiple bits errors are statistically unlikely to occur within the same byte but it is possible, so an error <b>may go unnoticed.</b>

### Mission-Critical Systems and Error Correction codes
- Mission-critical systems need a higher level of fault tolerance than parity checking can give
## Error Correcting codes(ECCs)
    - These use multiple extra bits to identify multi-bit errors with a byte and can correct single bit errors.
    
## Words and Word Alignment
- A word is a fixed-size piece of data that is manipulated as single unit by the instruction
set or by the hardware of the processor
- The number of bis in a word is called the word length
- The word length reflects the structure and operation of the computer
    - Register sizes
    - Maximum data transfer between processor and memory in a single operation
    - Memory characteristics
    - Data bus size
    - Largest possible physical address size
- In modern computers, bytes are generally grouped into 4 or 8-byte words and instructions manipulate an entire word as a single unit
- Words start a position 4,8,16... for 4-byte words and 8,16,32... for 8-byte words
- Sometimes, data in a word does not take up the entire word
- Consider a machine with a 4-byte word size. In this word, we could use all 32 bits to store an integer in the range from -1 to -2^31 and from 0 to (2^32)-1, for example
- However, suppose we only wanted to store a single ASCII character. In that case 3 bytes of the word would go unused
- There is therefore a trade-off between having a uniform word size, and the simplicity that it brings, and the amount of memory that might go unused
- <span style="color:lightblue;">This trade-off also applies when different instructions in the instruction set have different lengths...</span>
- One option, to use the memory more fully is to use multiple word lengths for each kind of data or to adopt the length of the smallest data type and to encode other data types as multiples of this minimum size(usually 1 byte)
- Both schemes can adversely affect performance by either complicating memory address calculations to account for non-alignment or by increasing the number of memory accesses when fetching data > 1 byte in size
- <span style="color:red;">Thus the trade-off is ultimately in terms of speed and space</span>

## Endianness
- Endianness refers to how the bytes of a word are stored in memory
    - Big Endian
    - Little Endian

- In Big Endian, the most significant byte(Byte 1) is stored in the lowest memory address, Byte 2 is stored in the next lowest address, etc.
- In Little Endian, the least significant byte(Byte 4) is stored at the lowest address, Byte 3 at the next lowest, etc.

## Locality of Reference
### The tendency for a set of Memory locations to be accessed multiple times over a short period of time.
There are 2 kinds : 
- Locality in time, temporal locality
    - The same data is referred to multiple times over a short period time
    - This data should be in fast access storage to speed up subsequent accesses
- Locality in space, spatial locality
    - A particular set of addresses are accessed multiple times over a short period of time
    - Nearby data should be stored in fast access storage to speed to multiple accesses
- Knowledge of locality offers a chance for predictability and thus performance optimisation using prefetching and caching
- Locality follows from program structure: programming language constructs(for, while, if,etc.) and data structures 
- Thus proper software organisation creates opportunities for locality of reference and proper memory hierarchies exploit this locality

## Von Neumann Machines
- Probably all of the computers with which you are familiar are von Neumann machines
- A computer is a von Neumann machine if 
    - It has a CPU, main memory, and I/O system
    - It is a stored program computer
        - The main memory system holds the program that controls its operation and the computer can manipulate its own program more than once

Harvard Architectures are a class of von Neumann machines except that they provide independent pathways for data addresses, data instruction addresses and instructions allowing the CPU to access instructions and data simultaneously
- Harvard architectures are prevalent in microcontrollers
