## Filter Selectors
- a : hover

- a[attribute]

- a :: first-child

## Conflicts
### A conflict is when 2 rules select the same element and assign different values to the same property of the element.

### Example
h1{<br>
    color:red;<br>
}

h1{<br>
    color:blue;<br>
}

## Resolving conflicts
### The word *Cascade* in 'CSS'
- The conflict resolution *cascades* :
    1. Importance/Origin
    2. Specificity
    3. Order

### Origins
1. Important user rules
2. Important author rules
3. Normal author rules
4. Normal user rules
5. Browser rules

### Origins Part 2 
1. Inline styling
2. `<style>` tag in the document
3. Imported stylesheets

### Specificity
1. E.g. id is the most specific rule and gets highest priority generally.
2. Selecting by class
3. Selector with more parent-child/ancestor-descendant/siblings relationships

### Order
- If two rules have the same specificity, the later rule wins.
