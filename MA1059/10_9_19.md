The Real Number Line models the continuum of the real numbers

Points on this line are represented by real numbers, these include :
- The Natural Numbers N = {1,2,3...}
- The Integers Z = {0,1,-1,2,-2...}
- The Rational Numbers Q = {p/q | p *E* Z, q *E* N}
Every number has a unique location on the line.

There are Real Numbers that are not rational, e.g. Pi, called Irrational Numbrs.
The Real Numbers R is the union of Rational and Irrational Numbers.

Using Strict Inclusion : N subset of Z subset of Q subset of R

Intervals : 
The arithmetic of rational numbers carries over to real numbers. Further, the real numbers are ordered by a relation <
We define x < y as :
x lies strictly to the left of y on the line

This order obeys the following : 
1. For any x,y *E* R, precisely one statement is true :<br>
x < y   <br>x > y<br>   x = y<br>
This is called the Law of Trichotomy.
