## Two-Table Queries

### `CROSS JOIN` - Forms Cartesian Products

`SELECT` *<br>
`FROM` persons `CROSS JOIN` favourite_foods;
#### This gives all possible combinations of rows in table 1 with rows in table 2.

#rows() = #rows(persons) x rows(favourite_foods)<br>
#cols() = #cols(persons) + cols(favourite_foods)

### `ON` - Similar to `WHERE`
`SELECT` * <br>
`FROM` persons `JOIN` favourite_foods<br>
`ON` persons.person_id = favourite_foods.person_id;
#### This merges the data from the two tables where the *person_id*s are the same

### Food Preferences...
- List all the students who like pizza

`SELECT` *<br>
`FROM` persons `JOIN` favourite_foods<br>
`ON` persons.person_id = favourite_foods.person_id<br>
`WHERE` food = 'Pizza';

`SELECT` first_name, last_name, '  likes ', food<br>
`FROM`
    persons `AS` p<br>
    `JOIN` favourite_foods `AS` f<br>
    `ON` p.person_id = f.person_id<br>
`WHERE` food = 'pizza';

### Another example
    List all pairs of students who hail from the same county(not just the same as all those from a specific county)

    Use just the persons table, but forms join of table with itself(two 'copies')

First try :<br>
`SELECT`<br>
p1.first_name, p1.last_name, ' and ',<br>
p2.first_name, p2.last_name, ' both hail from ', <br>
p1.county<br>
`FROM`<br>
persons `AS` p1<br>
`JOIN`persons `AS` p2<br>
`ON` p1.county = p2.county;

#### Problems
- Person could be joined with himself
