## Tables
- Predominant database concept since 1980s
- Conceptually organises data into sets of two dimensional tables
- Many relational DB software packages

Open source :
- MySQL
- Postgres

Proprietary :
- Microsoft, etc.
### Example Table
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Students</th>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>City</td>
    <td>Points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Connor</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>Cork</td>
    <td>480</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Mary</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>Limerick</td>
    <td>465</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Thomas</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>Cork</td>
    <td>625</td>
</tr>
</table>

Conceptually relational databases are based on tables, as they are conceptually intuitive, simple and elegant.

<b>Database : </b> A database consists of a set of named relations (aka tables)

#### Relation :
- A set of *tuples*(rows) with identical column structure
- Each column named with an *attribute*(must be distinct)
- Values in each column of uniform "type" drawn from some set(domain) such as int, text, date etc.

According to relational models, all rows should be distinct, DB systems don't always enforce this however
- Values must be *atomic*(elementary and unstructured)
- E.g. ints, decimals, text, booleans, dates..
- Can't have lists, sets,arrays as single values

We distinguish between :
- Database Schema : The structure of the database in terms of constituent tables and the organisation of each table in terms of attributes and domains and the interpretation of these in terms of the real-world situation the DB models remains fixed over time
- Database Instance : Any specific collection of values populating the DB that conforms to the schema; changes as DB is modified
- When speaking of "the academic records database" we generally mean the former

### What is SQL?
- Computer language for expressing management, manipulation and querying of relational databases

### Support
- <b>Good news : </b> "Standard" DB language, most common DBMSs support itl free open source packages available
- <b>Bad News : </b> Most DBMSs adopt their own "dialects"

### SQL incorporates several aspects :
#### Data Manipulation Language(DML) :
- notation for expressing
- management of DB
- manipulation, adding/removing/updating tupls
- queries to interrogate DB

#### Data Definition Language(DDL) :
- 

#### SQL Query
`SELECT` name, points<br/>
`FROM` students<br/>
`WHERE` points >= 500;

Results from above table would be :<br/>
<table>
<tr><td>Name</td><td>Points</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thomas</td><td>625</td></tr>
</table>

- First part specifies attributes of interest(note comma separators)
- Second bit specifies which table the query applies to
- Third part specifies *criterion* for rows of interest. For each row, condition "points >= 500" is true or false based on the points value in that row. Only the row where condition is satisfied appear in result
