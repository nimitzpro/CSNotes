## Normalisation
- Standards regarding DBs
- Design methodology guided by careful analysis of these can help reduce undesirable redundancy patterns.

### Functional Dependencies
- Dependencies capture how different attributes in the table interrelate
- Dependencies are dictated (directly or indirectly) by the semantics of the DB attributes
#### Definition 
Given relation *R*, attribute *Y* is functionally dependent on attribute *X*(denoted *X* -> *Y*) if and only if, whenever 2 tuples of *R* agree on their *X* value, they are also guaranteed to agree also on their *Y* value.

#### Problems in DBs with undesirable redundancy
- Update anomaly
- Remove anomaly
- Insert anomaly

### Normal Forms
- **First Normal Form** : The DB is atomically split into attributes(no tuples,etc. in one attributes) 
- **Second Normal Form** : DB without non-full dependencies
- **Third Normal Form** : DB without transitive dependencies
