## ER Diagrams etc.
### General DB Design Principles
- Faithfulness
    - Should reflect the real world aspects which need to be stored in the DB
- Simplicity
    - Database should be as simple as possible, but no simpler
- Avoid redundancy
    - Each piece of information should be represented only once
    - Duplicate info. is wasteful of space and encourages inconsistencies when more info. is added.

### Generating DB Schema from ER Diagrams
#### Basic Idea
- Each entity set is represented by a table
- Each relationship is also represented by a table
#### Caution
- Further refinements needed to weed out poor designs

#### Weak entity set : A set with no natural unique key, e.g. dependants.
