## ER Diagrams
### Database Models
- While designing databases it's handy to have notation to sketch schemas
- Two common diagrammatic notations :
    - UML diagrams(Universal Modelling Language)
    - ER diagrams(Entity Relationships)

### Database Development Process    
1. Requirements analysis : figure out what is required of our database
2. Design :
    - Develop an ER diagram to sketch a design that meets these requirements
    - Translate ER diagram into details DB schema
3. Implementation : Generate SQL code for the design

### Entities
- An entity is a "thing"
- An entity set is a collection of similar entities e.g. a collection of persons
- An attribute is some property of the entities in an entity set e.g. the date of birth of each person

### Relationships
- Relationship captures a connection between two or more entity sets
- Entity sets : students, modules
    - Alice is taking cs1106
    - Bob loves cs1106

- The value of an entity set is the set of entities that currently belong to it
- The value of a relationship is a relationship set, the set of tuples with one component for each related entity set

### Types of Relationships
- Many - Many
- Many - One
- One - Many
