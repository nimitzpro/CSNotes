## `HAVING` vs `WHERE`

### `WHERE` cannot have an aggregate in the criterion specification(e.g. `SUM`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, etc.)
### `HAVING` clause can't have un-aggregated attributes other than those in `GROUP BY` clause

### What Regions Contain At Least 10 Countries?
#### Counts the number of countries for all regions
`SELECT` region, `COUNT(*)`<br>
`FROM` countries<br>
`GROUP BY` region;<br>

#### Solution for >=10 countries
`SELECT` region, `COUNT(*)`<br>
`FROM` countries<br>
`GROUP BY` region<br>
`HAVING COUNT`(*) >= 10;

### Which Regions Have Populations in Excess of 1 Billion?

`SELECT` region, `SUM`(population)<br>
`FROM` countries<br>
`GROUP BY` region<br>
`HAVING SUM`(population) >= 100000000;

### Which Regions Are Economically Homogeneous?
- GDP per capita = GDP/population
- List the max and min per capita GDP for all regions where the max GDP/capita is at most five times the minimum GDP/capita

`SELECT` region, `MIN`(gdp/population), `MAX`(gdp/population)<br>
`FROM` countries<br>
`GROUP BY` region<br>
`HAVING MAX`(gdp/population) < 5 * `MIN`(gdp/population);

## Subqueries
### Which Country Has the Largest Population?
`SELECT` name, population<br>
`FROM` countries<br>
`WHERE` population = (`SELECT MAX`(population) `FROM` countries);
