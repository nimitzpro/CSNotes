### The absolute value of a number
For x *E* R
Define its absolute value |x| by 2 things :<br/>
x if x >= 0<br>
-x if x < 0<br>

Then |x| >= 0 in all cases, but in fact if x != 0, then the |x| > 0, where |x| = 0 only where x = 0.

Let r > 0 Then |x| < r is the set of numbers :<br/>
If x >= 0 then |x| = x < r or <br>
if x < 0 then |x| = -x < r <br>
x > -r<br>
Hence {x *E* R | |x| <r} = {x *E* R | -r < x < r}
= {-r,r}

|x| < r  <=>  x *E* (-r,r)<br>
More generally, for r > 0 and any a *E* R
<br>The set {x *E* R | |x-a| < r} = {x *E* R | a-r < x < a+r}<br/>
Furthermore |x-y| is the distance between x and y.

I(a,e) = {x *E* R | |x-a| < r}<br>
I'(a,r) = {x *E* R | 0 < |x-a| < r} = I(a,r)\{a}


### Functions 
Let A and B be sets. A function between A and B is an assignment which assigns to each element of A and element of B. Write f : A -> B for such a function.<br>
If a *E* A, then the corresponding element in B is written as f(a)<br>
f(a) = b, where b *E* B

Example : A = {This class}, B = **N** and the function f:A->B assigns the age of a student.

Example 2 : A = B = **R** and f(x) = x^2

### Graph of a function
Let f:A->B be a function<br>
The graph of f is the set {[x subset of f(x)] *E* A x B | x *E* A} subset of A x B<br>
A x B is a Cartesian Product.

#### N.B. The graph of a function needs vertical lines at least once

### Composition of Functions
If f:A->B and g:B->C, then their composition gOf is defined by <br>
(gOf)(a) = g(f(a)), a *E* A

Example : A,B,C = **R**<br>
f(x) = x+4, g(x) = x^2 + 4<br>
Then (gOf)(x) = g(x+4) = (x+4)^2 + 4 = <br>
x^2 + 8x + 20 <br>
while (fOg)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2 + 4) = x^2 + 4 + 4 = x^2 + 8 These are functions P:**R**->**R** of the form P(X) = a*0* + a*1*x + a*2*x^2+...+a*n*x^*n* 
where a*0*,a*1*,a*n* *E* R are called the coefficient of P. If a*n* != 0, then P is said to have degree n, written as
deg(P) = n

Examples :<br>
 P(x) = -37x^5 + 2x^215<br>
P(x) = 17 -x^3 + 21x^5

### Arithmetic of Functions
If f:**R**->**R** and g:**R** are 2 functions, then <br>
(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)<br>
(fg)(x) = f(x).g(x)

### Rational Functions
These are functions of the form
f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) where P and Q are polynomials.<br>
Such are defined for all x *E* R except the roots of Q.
