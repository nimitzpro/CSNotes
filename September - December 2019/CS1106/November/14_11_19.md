## Case Study - Mongo's Kitchen
- Mongo's famous takeaway wants DB-based order submission website
- Needs DB backend to house data to support this

#### Model :
- Customer submit order via form
- Receives confirmation with order number and price
- Collects completed order in person later

### Order Details
For each order we need to keep track of 
- Customer's details
- Items ordered and quantity (and price)
- Status
    - `received -> posted -> completed -> collected`
- DB should support order processing such as 
    - List items on menu and prices
    - Calculate price of an order
    - Generate list of active orders
- Should also help production of business summary info
    - Determine total sales etc.

### Entity Sets
- customers : names, addresses etc.
- menu_items : items on offer, descriptions, prices
- orders : order number
- staff : 
    - staff number, name
    - to keep track of who handles order in case of problems

### Relationships
- placed_by : which customers placed which orders
- includes : 
    - which items are in which order
    - attribute : quantity of item in the order
- progressed_by : 
    - which staff members processed the order
    - attributes : order status and time-stamps
    -(tracks order progress and times)

### DB Schema
- customers
- orders
- menu_items
- staff
- placed_by
- progressed_by

#### Note : no weak entity types in this design
