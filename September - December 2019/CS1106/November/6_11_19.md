## Creating ER Diagrams from Requirements
- Judgement is required to determine appropriate entities and relationships
- Rule of Thumb
    - Candidates for entity sets often conveniently describable using nouns, e.g. employees, departments etc.
    - Candidates for relationships often describable using verbs e.g. supervises, works on, etc.

### Entities
- employees
    - <u>ppsn</u>, firstname, lastname, gender, dob, salary
- departments
- projects
- locations
- dependants

#### Attributes that form the keys of the entity set are underlined

### Relationships
- manages (who manages which department)
- worksin (who work in which department)
- workson (who works on which project)
- supervises (who supervises who)
- haslocation (which departments have which locations)
- locatedat (which projects are located where)
- isdependantof (which individuals are dependants of which employees)
