## Subqueries
- These are queries made out of simpler queries
- Using the movies DB
    - movies, actors, castings
### Problem
- List films ids with both Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn
#### Although this is possible with joins another way would be to use subqueries.
- Separately find HB's films and those of KH
- Find the films in common(intersection)
#### Intersection and difference are not supported by MySQL but *Union* is.
- List ids of all actors whose name is 'Jack' or who have at least 10 films to their credit
- Two subqueries involving actors and castings separately

### List the Film(s) with the Greatest Score
`SELECT` title, score<br>
`FROM` movies<br>
`WHERE` score = <br>
(`SELECT MAX`(score)<br>
`FROM` movies);
### List the IDs of all Actors appearing in "The Godfather"
`SELECT` actorid<br>
`FROM` castings<br>
`WHERE` movieid =<br>
(`SELECT` id<br>
`FROM` movies<br>
`WHERE` title = 'Godfather, The');

## Subqueries returning One-Column Results
- Tables containing a single column are known as unary relations; such relations are effectively lists
### Subquery Conditionals
- SQl provides some Boolean functions that operate on a unary relation :
    - `EXISTS R` : True if R is not empty
    - `S IN R` : True if S is in R (`NOT IN`)
    - `S > R` : True if S is greater than all values in R
    - `S < R` : True if S is lower than all values in R
    - `S = R` : True if S is equal to all values in R

### List the Names of all Actors Appearing in "The Godfather"
#### My attempt
`SELECT` name<br>
`FROM` actors<br>
`WHERE` id `IN`<br>
(`SELECT` actorid from castings<br>
`JOIN` movies<br>
`WHERE` title = 'Godfather, The'<br>
`AND` movieid = id);
#### Officially
`SELECT` name<br>
`FROM` actors<br>
`WHERE` id `IN`<br> 
(`SELECT` actorid `FROM` castings<br>
`WHERE` movieid = (<br>
    `SELECT` id `FROM` movies<br>
    `WHERE` title = 'Godfather, The'));

## Subqueries Returning Multi-Column Tables
- Can use subqueries instead of table names in `FROM` clauses

`SELECT`<br>
`FROM` (/*subquery*/) `AS` subquery_name<br>
`WHERE` ...

### What is the greatest number of films made by any actor?
- Subquery to count the number films per actor using `GROUP by` and `COUNT` on castings table
- Containing query uses `MAX` to determine largest count

`SELECT MAX`(num_films)<br>
`FROM`<br>
(`SELECT` actorid, `COUNT`(movieid) `AS` 'num_films'<br>
`FROM` castings<br>
`GROUP BY` actorid)<br>
`AS` film_counts;

### Above question with the Actor's name
`SELECT` name, `COUNT`(\*)<br>
`FROM` actors `AS` a<br>
`JOIN` castings `AS` c<br>
`ON` a.id = c.actorid<br>
`GROUP BY` a.id<br>
`HAVING COUNT`(\*) = <br>
(`SELECT MAX`(num_films)<br>
`FROM`<br>
(`SELECT` actorid, `COUNT`(movieid) `AS` 'num_films'<br>
`FROM` castings<br>
`GROUP BY` actorid)<br>
`AS` film_counts);
