### List the names of all pairs of actors that have appeared together in more than four films
- Use join to generate all "co-appearances" : pairs of actor-castings relative to the same fim
- Use grouping and aggregation on join table for counting

`HAVING COUNT`(\*) > 4<br>
`ORDER BY COUNT`(*) `DESC`;

### List alphabetically all the actors who have appeared in a film with a score below 3.0 and also in a film with a score above 8.5
- Use join to generate actor-appearance1-appearance2 tuples
    - Where appearances1/appearances2 relate to actor
- Filter to ensure appearance1 is a bad film (< 3.0) and appearance2 is a good film ( > 8.5)
- actors x castings(1) x movies(1) x castings(2) x movies(2)
