### The `cmp` Instruction
- The `cmp` instruction is used to compare values in registers with each other and with literal values
- `cmp` works by subtracting the operands(without storing any result, so it is not destructive unlike add) and possibly setting the flags based on the result
    - If the values are equal, the 0 flag is set
    - If the second operand is larger than the first, the sign flag is set - the result of the subtraction is negative
    - If the first operand is larger than the second, no flag is set

### Interacting with the External Environment
- The Samphire simulator uses the IN and OUT instructions to get input from, and to send output to, a specified *Port*
- Thus for example
    - IN 00
    - This gets the input from Port 00(this port is linked to the keyboard in Samphire) and places it into the AL register(by design)
- Input coming from the keyboard will be ASCII data
- Thus if the user presses the '0' key in response to the IN 00 instruction, the value 30 will be placed into the AL register

### Converting ASCII to integer
- If we wish to work with numbers rather than character, we simply subtract the ASCII value for '0' (30 hex) from the numeric character read from the keyboard
- It is assumed that the user will only press numeric character and the result <=9

#### To read and write multi-digit number, we must perform some arithmetic
- Suppose we wish to read the numeric characters '2','3' as the integer 23, we could proceed as follows:
    - Read the first character
    -Convert it to an integer
    - Multiply it by 10
    - Read the second character
    - Convert it to an integer
    - Add the first integer to the second integer

`in 00`<br>
`sub al, 30`<br>
`mul al, 0A`<br>
`push al`<br>
`pop bl`<br>

`in 00`<br>
`sub al, 30`<br>
`add al, bl`<br>

`push al`<br>
`pop bl`<br>

`div al, 0a`<br>
`add al, 30`<br>
`mov [c0], al`<br>

`mod bl, 0a`<br>
`add bl, 30`<br>
`mov [cl], bl`<br>
`end`
