# Subroutines and Structural Programming
- The delay code is a useful subtask which supports the main task of turning on and off the lights
- These subtask programs are called subroutines and correspond to functions, methods and procedures of high-level languages
- Delaying is an action that is required at multiple points in the traffic lights program. As such, it would be efficient if we only had to write the code once but use it multiple times
- This facility would also introduce a degree of structure to our program by formalising the way in which we access and leave subroutines
- However this requires additional hardware and instructions at the ISA Level and additional mnemonics at the Assembly Language Level

## The Stack
- A Stack is a way of structuring information and accessing that information in a first-in-last-out manner
- This contrasts with a queue, for example, which is accessed in a first-in-first-out manner
#### The Samphire Stack begins at address `BF` - this is known as the 'bottom of the stack'

- The operations `push` and `pop` move data in and out of the stack
- In a queue `join` and `serve` are used instead
- The address of the next free location on the stack is kept in the stack pointer (SP) register
- In the RAM view, this free location is marked by a blue cursor
- The address of the most recent value added to the stack is located at SP+1
- If the Stack Pointer holds BF, the stack is said to be empty

#### The `push` Instruction
1. Decrements SP by 1
2. Copies the value in its operand register into the location held in the SP

#### The `pop` Instruction
1. Adds 1 to the SP
2. Moves the value held at SP into the register entered

### Subroutine Call-Return Mechanism
- Call-Return provides low-level support for the implementation of subroutines
#### The `call` Instruction
1. Transfers control to the called subroutine by placing the subroutine address into the Instruction Pointer (IP)
2. Pushes the address of the instruction that follows the `call` instruction (aka the return address) onto the stack.

Format :
- `call` address
    - Where address is the memory address of the start of the subroutine
- To help determine the start address of a subroutine, Samphire uses *Assembler-chan* : `org`-kun
- `org`-kun tells Assembler-chan to place the following instructions/data into memory starting at a specific address
- `org` address
- To close the subroutine, `ret` is used

mov al, 30<br>
call 70<br>
mov [c0], al

org 70<br>
;Code of the subroutine starts here ---<br>
add al, 1 <br>
ret<br>
;---<br>

### How can we have a different delay for each call of the subroutine?
- We somehow convey the delay the duration to the subroutine from the calling location
    1. We can simply set the value of the bl register to the desired delay before making the call and the subroutine uses this value as before
    2. We put the value on the stack before making the call and add appropriate code to the subroutine to access it correctly
- Method 1 = Global Variable
- Method 2 = Passing a parameter
Both methods have advantages and disadvantages depending on your perspective and the abstraction level that you are working on.

- Method 2 is more flexible
- We not only use the stack to pass parameters, we also use it to store the values of all the registers from the calling environment
- This, *context switch*, allows us to reuse all the registers in processing the code of the subroutine without fear of overwriting their values from another context
- When the subroutine ends, the context can be switch again
